Write a post about what specs you look for in a new computer. Why?

I haven't shopped around for a new computer in a while (Thank you Apple!), but I still remember the struggle very clearly. When I'm looking for a new computer I pay attention to the memory space and harddrive space. I was (and would still be if I had the space on my PC lol) a Sims game junkie since I was a teenager and I learned at an early age the importance of space on a computer. I have way too many pictures, songs, and files on my computer. When it comes to buying a new PC, space can be a deal breaker for me.
 
Another key factor, depending on what you'll need the computer for, is the type of processor that the computer has. Usually the cheaper PCs on the market will probably have an AMD processor. The processor is what gives you speed. Normally if you just use your PC for the basics (checking social media, emails, or typing up documents), an average processor would be able to handle that at a decent speed without a problem. If you are a heavy duty gamer or if you use your computer for more than just the average consumer need, then you might want to invest in a better processor. 

I also pay attention to hardware specs too. I like my PC to have multiple USB ports, an HDMI port, DVD player, SD card slot, and of course WiFi. To me these components are important because they allow me to use my computer to its full potential. In terms of hardware name brands, I've had a good experience with Dell, HP, and Asus. In terms of operating systems, I've had better luck with Mac OS than Microsoft Windows. Being a computer fanatic, I would love to have a Windows computer with lots of space and speed just for my Sims game and a Mac laptop (with the bootcamp option) to handle all of my other things like music, pictures and etc.
