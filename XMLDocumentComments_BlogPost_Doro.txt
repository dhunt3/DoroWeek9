XML Documentation Comments

Ever notice how little comments appear when your cursor rests inside the parentheses of something like 
Console.WriteLine(|)...?

Those comments are called (or considered) XML Documentation comments. These comments will give a brief 
summary or description about that particular method.

How do we add these cool comments, also called ToolTip?

This is how I added the comments (thanks Google!):

1. I created a Class Library project in Visual Studios.
2. Created my little library. Example = adding classes, methods, etc...
3. Under the Project tab in VS, I clicked on the properties command.
4. From within the properties menu, I clicked on the Build settings.
5. Within the Build settings, I checked in the XML Document File box. Close out of the properties menu.

Now time to make some comments!

1. On the line right above the beginning of your method, start your XML (ToolTip) comment with 3 /. (///).
2. Once you do this, type in <summary>. Example = ///<summary>
3. In the next line you can write the description of your method. Example = ///Description
4. You can close out your summary with </summary>. Example ///</summary>

So overall your ToolTip comments can look like this:


	///<summary>
	///This method takes 2 integers and adds them together
	///</summary>

public static void Add(int x, int y)
        {
            int sum = x + y;
            Console.WriteLine("Your sum is " + sum);
        }

After you Build your solution and use your library from a Console Application program (don't forget to reference
your library), you will see your comment appear when your cursor rests inside ClassName.Add(|)...

Quick tip (use Add method parameter x for example below): 

///<param name="x">Parameter description</param>

Will explain what the parameter is/does (if you choose to do so).

The end! Hope this helps!
